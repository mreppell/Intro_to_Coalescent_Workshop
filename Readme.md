#An introduction to the coalescent

These materials were used to provide a brief introduction to the coalescent model, as well as hands on experience running coalescent simulations using ms (Hudson 2002). They were originally taught at Dordt College in July 2015.

##Lectures

The lectures folder contains four lectures:

1. Introducing the coalescent
2. Summarizing genetic variation
3. Extensions to the basic coalescent: population structure, growth, and recombination
4. Simulating phenotypes using coalescent data (with an aside on natural selection)

##Labs

The lab folder contains three labs, written in R Markdown.

1. Some Linux command line basics, installing ms, interpreting ms output
2. Using program sample_stats, exploring relationship between scaled mutation rate and summary statistics
3. Coalescent simulation with recombination, population growth, and population structure

It also includes the script coalescent_sfs.pl which calculates the average SFS from ms simulation output.
